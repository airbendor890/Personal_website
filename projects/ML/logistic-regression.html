    <h3 style="text-align: center;">K-Means Clustering Algorithm</h3>
    <p>K-means clustering is one of the simplest and intutive clustering Algorithm.  The algorithm alternates 
        between two steps: assigning each data point to the
        closest cluster center, and then setting each cluster center as the mean of the data
        points that are assigned to it. The algorithm is finished when the assignment of
        instances to clusters no longer changes.

    <p>The algotith is succeptible to getting stuck in a local minima based on
        initial choice of centroids or cluster centers.
